# Issue Tracker

## Scenario:
A customer has requested a Single Page Application (SPA) for an issue log application. They have
specified that they want to:

- Create, view, edit and destroy issues
- Mark issues as complete or pending
- Upload files that are associated with an issue
- Download files associated with an issue
- Create and view comments on issues

The requirements are likely to change in the future, so the code will need to be flexible and maintainable.

## Notes:

- If you make any assumptions, please document them.
- Please keep track of the time it takes for you to implement the challenge

## Task:

Design a RESTful API for the above scenario.

## Specs:

### Required:
- Done with Node.js
- Use hapijs or express
- Mongodb with Mongoose for storage (files may may be stored in the local file system for simplicity)
- Use Git for version control
- Full test suite using Mocha/Chai or Lab/Code
- Inline function documentation
- API spec

### Bonus:
- Utilize any relevant ES6 features
